    The ZK/U residency program is a platform for cross-disciplinary exchange between artists, scholars and practitioners. My 3 month residency was divided into two parts. The first two month were sponsored, and were focusend on the theme of the emergency contraception in Berlin. 
    The second part of the residency focused on the theme of failed pictures. I wanted to explore the vulnerability and emotional connection that the audience could experience with them.

    The “Body Mapping Lab” was a performance residency which took place in Teufelsberg, a former US spy radio-station during the Cold War. Today it is repurposed as a street art gallery. The residency’s objective was to analyse how the body’s physical form plays a role in the building's on-going history through reading groups, body exercises and thematic walks. The result of the researches has been shared during Memorial Day in a one-hour performance.
