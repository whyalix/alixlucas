    The “Body Mapping Lab” was a performance residency which took place in Teufelsberg, a former US spy radio-station during the Cold War. Today it is repurposed as a street art gallery. The residency’s objective was to analyse how the body’s physical form plays a role in the building's on-going history through reading groups, body exercises and thematic walks. The result of the researches has been shared during Memorial Day in a one-hour performance.
