I am a non-binary trans masculine person, born in Paris from Filipino heritage. 
I am working with printing for a decade,  ranging from analog photography to screenprinting. 
Through my art, I want to create immersive experiences that transport the viewer outside of the comfort zone of a passive contemplator. 

I explore by the ways technology shapes our perceptions and interactions with reality and how it could be a support for the LGBTQIA+ community.
My work is an invitation to engage in a dialogue about the role of technology in shaping our understanding of ourselves and the world around us. 
Through installations, photographs, and print-making, I seek to challenge our preconceptions and encourage a deeper, more nuanced exploration of the complex relationship between humanity and the digital realm.  
I believe that art has the power to bring comfort to the marginalized and to educate the others, and I am committed to using my work to contribute to a broader conversation about the intersection of technology and trans-identity.
