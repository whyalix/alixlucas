Perfect images surround us. Photoshopped, curated and retouched: images are heavily restricted and kept under strict control. 

It raises the important question:
“What makes a successful picture nowadays?”

FAILED. pivots in a different direction. 
In contrast to the artificial perfection of digital photography, the installation offers the public to connect with analog-shot photos where the unexpected prevails. 
FAILED. encourages us to experience in a positive way, pictures that went wrong, labelled ‘useless’ with regards to the technical requirements of a perfect photo.  

This act of self-exposure challenges our notions of perfection and invites us to reconsider the value of vulnerability, bringing an experience of catharsis.
