Haunted dreams

How did you come with the idea of Haunted dreams?
In 2016, after a decade of digital photography, I started to embrace the experimental possibilities of analog photography. I was first exposed to it when my neighbour gave me an old Yashica camera from the 1970’s. The camera was broken but I loved the aesthetic of the prints it produced in the dark room. I then decided to collecting old cameras and focused on the emotions, vulnerabilities and flaws behind the human creative process.

Can you tell us more about the creative process that is involved in this project?
First of all, I explore the possibilities of my  broken cameras. The pictures often come out blurry, overexposed or out of focus. It reveals an obsolete, dreamy and intimate aspect of the pictures. 
I develop all the pictures myself in the dark room. 
 I want the process to appear on the final work. For example, I would intentionally leave dust on the photographic films, fingerprints. Sometimes, I would also use chemicals that are out of date, or broken tanks to develop the films. 
This process is extremely cathartic, because it removes the anxiety to produce the perfect result. Exhibiting the work is an act of self exposure, and it could be frightening. It  happens that the audience does not understand why the pictures looks so different from what they are used to see and be quite critical about it. Ù

What are you trying to demonstrate through this project?
Through “Haunted dreams” I want to advocate diversity and inclusivity by showing authentic unedited images that aren’t perfect. Nowadays, we are constantly surrounded by images that are thoroughly edited to show perfect content.  This constant race for perfection can be very stressful and puts a lot of weight on out shoulders. I want to give a different perspective to images. I want to give the audience the opportunity to use their imagination and participate creatively in the interpretation of the images. I hope that my imperfect pictures will educate people and help them to see beauty where it can be hidden.

The work has been shown through different exhibition, and was also displayed during a 5 hours interactive show in Kreuzberg Pavillon in Berlin in 2017.  
The setting was composed of a bedside table, a ceramic figurine and a pinboard, creating a favorable environment for an intimate and dreamy experience.  7 pictures were displayed face down on the pinboard. 
Every 45 minutes, the youngest visitor revealed a picture for the audience to discover a new fragment of the dream. 
The rhythmic presentation of the work allowed the audience to live the dream in real time,  and made them active in the process of looking at an image.
