Haunted dreams

The setting of the exhibition is composed of a bedside table, a frame, a ceramic figurine and a pinboard, creating a favorable environment for an intimate and dreamy experience. There are 7 pictures displayed on the pinboard but they can’t be seen yet, as they are hung face down. Every 30 minutes, the youngest visitor reveals a picture for the audience to discover a new fragment of the dream. The rhythmic presentation of the work allows the audience to live the dream in real time, a dream filled with childhood memories and poesy.

- How did you come with the idea of Haunted dreams?

In 2016, after a decade of digital photography, I started to embrace the experimental possibilities of analog photography. I was first exposed to it when my neighbour gave me an old Yashica camera from the 1970’s. The camera was broken but I loved the aesthetic of the prints it produced in the dark room. I started collecting old and broken cameras in flea markets and focused on the emotions, vulnerabilities and flaws behind the human creative process.

- Can you tell us more about the creative process that is involved in this project?

First of all, I explore the possibilities of my old and broken cameras. The pictures often come out blurry, overexposed or out of focus. But I love the obsolete, dreamy and intimate aspect of the pictures. 
Then, I develop the pictures in the dark room. Rather than concentrating myself on the results, I focus on the making process. I would intentionally leave dust on the photographic films, fingerprints and sometimes I would use chemicals that are out of date. 
This process gives to the pictures a dreamy and intimate aspect, which really pleases me a lot and because the images aren’t perfect they seem vulnerable. This vulnerability inspired me because it took the weight of image perfection off my shoulders.  

- What are you trying to demonstrate through this project?

Through “Haunted dreams” I want to advocate diversity and inclusivity by showing authentic unedited images that aren’t perfect. Nowadays, we are constantly surrounded by images that are thoroughly edited to show perfect content.  This constant race for perfection can be very stressful and puts a lot of weight on out shoulders. I want to give a different perspective to images. I want to give the audience the opportunity to use their imagination and participate creatively in the interpretation of the images. I hope that my imperfect pictures will educate people and help them to see beauty where it can be hidden.
