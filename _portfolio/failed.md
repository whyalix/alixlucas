Perfect images surround us. Photoshopped, curated and retouched: images are heavily restricted and kept under strict control. 
It raises the important question: “What makes a successful picture nowadays?” 

The art work FAILED. pivots in a different direction. In contrast to the artificial perfection of digital photography, the installation offers the public to connect with analog shot photos where the unexpected prevails. Blurry, out of frame the subject become almost abstract.

FAILED. encourages us to experience in a positive way pictures that went wrong, labelled ‘useless’ with regards to the technical requirements of a good picture.

This act of self exposure challenges our notions of perfection and invites us to reconsider the value of vulnerability. 
The pictures create a cathartic experience where the audience can emotionaly connect with the pictures.
